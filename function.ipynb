    "#How to Define a Generator\n",
    "#Generators are defined using two primary methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Generator Functions (using the yield keyword).\n",
    "#Generator Expressions (using a compact syntax similar to list comprehensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Generator Function\n",
    "#A generator function is a function that contains one or more yield statements. Each time the function is called, it produces a value and pauses, maintaining its state. When you call next() on the generator, it resumes from where it left off and continues to yield values until the function is exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example of a Generator Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def count_up_to(max):\n",
    "    count = 1\n",
    "    while count <= max:\n",
    "        yield count  # Yield the current count and pause\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a generator object\n",
    "counter = count_up_to(5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the generator\n",
    "print(next(counter))  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(next(counter))  # Output: 2\n",
    "print(next(counter))  # Output: 3\n",
    "print(next(counter))  # Output: 4\n",
    "print(next(counter))  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# After the generator is exhausted, it raises StopIteration\n",
    "# print(next(counter))  # Raises StopIteration exception\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Explanation of the Example:\n",
    "#The count_up_to function is a generator function. It starts a while loop that yields the value of count each time it's called.\n",
    "#The yield statement pauses the function, returning the value of count to the caller.\n",
    "#Every time next(counter) is called, the generator resumes from where it left off, incrementing count and yielding the next value.\n",
    "#After all values have been yielded, calling next() again raises a StopIteration exception, signaling that the generator is exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Generator Expression\n",
    "#A generator expression is a more concise way to create generators. It is similar to a list comprehension but uses parentheses () instead of square brackets [].\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example of a Generator Expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "# A generator expression to generate squares of numbers\n",
    "squares = (x * x for x in range(1, 6))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the generator\n",
    "print(next(squares))  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(next(squares))  # Output: 4\n",
    "print(next(squares))  # Output: 9\n",
    "print(next(squares))  # Output: 16\n",
    "print(next(squares))  # Output: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Explanation of the Example:\n",
    "#The expression (x * x for x in range(1, 6)) is a generator expression that yields the square of each number from 1 to 5.\n",
    "#Each call to next(squares) retrieves the next value in the sequence (the square of x).\n",
    "#After the generator has yielded all values, calling next(squares) again would raise a StopIteration exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Advantages of Generators:\n",
    "#Memory Efficiency: Since generators only generate values one at a time, they don't store the entire sequence in memory. This is especially useful when working with large datasets or streams.\n",
    "#Lazy Evaluation: You can work with potentially infinite sequences without loading the entire sequence into memory.\n",
    "#Improved Performance: For large datasets, generators can reduce memory usage and increase performance by yielding values only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Summary\n",
    "#Generators are a type of iterable that produce values one at a time using the yield statement.\n",
    "#They are defined either using a generator function (with yield) or a generator expression (with parentheses).\n",
    "#Generators are memory-efficient and support lazy evaluation, making them ideal for handling large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#In short, generators allow you to iterate over a sequence of data without the overhead of storing the entire sequence in memory, yielding one item at a time when requested."

    "\n",
    "#The primary advantages of using generators over regular functions in Python are memory efficiency and lazy evaluation. Here's how these advantages play out:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Memory Efficiency\n",
    "#Generators generate values one at a time, and only when needed, instead of returning a whole collection (like a list). This is especially useful for large datasets or when you need to handle a large number of values without using much memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Lazy Evaluation\n",
    "#With a generator, values are produced only when requested, not all at once. This makes it easier to handle large or infinite sequences of data without worrying about memory constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "#Let's compare a regular function and a generator that generates a sequence of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Regular Function (Returning a List)\n",
    "\n",
    "def generate_numbers(n):\n",
    "    return [i for i in range(n)]  # Returns a list of numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the function\n",
    "numbers = generate_numbers(1000000)  # This creates a large list in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "#In this case, the function creates a list of 1,000,000 numbers all at once, which can be very memory-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Generator (Using yield)\n",
    "\n",
    "def generate_numbers(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        yield i  # Yield numbers one at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the generator\n",
    "gen = generate_numbers(1000000)  # Doesn't create a list, just generates numbers one at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "#Here, the generator doesn't store the entire sequence in memory. It yields one number at a time, which is far more memory-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Key Advantages in the Example:\n",
    "#Memory Efficiency: The generator uses a constant, small amount of memory regardless of how large n is. The regular function creates a list that consumes memory for all 1,000,000 numbers at once.\n",
    "#Lazy Evaluation: With the generator, you only compute the next value when it's requested (e.g., when you iterate over it). This can be particularly useful when dealing with large or streaming data.\n",

    "\n",

    "#When is it typically used?\n",
    "#Lambda functions are commonly used in the following scenarios:\n",

    "#Data: We have four separate lists: order_numbers, book_titles, quantities, and prices.\n",
    "#calculate_total: This lambda function calculates the total cost of an order by multiplying the quantity and price. If the total cost is less than 100€, we add 10€ to it.\n",
    "#zip(): We use zip() to combine the three lists (order_numbers, quantities, and prices) into a single iterable of tuples. Each tuple contains an order number, a quantity, and a price.\n",
    "#map(): The map() function applies the lambda function to each tuple created by zip(). This processes each order, calculates the total cost (adjusted if needed), and returns a tuple of the order number and the computed total cost.\n",
    "#Result: The final result is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an order number and the adjusted total cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Key Points:\n",
    "#Lambda Functions: We use a lambda function to calculate the total cost and adjust it if necessary.\n",
    "#map(): The map() function applies the lambda to each element, simplifying the code and making it more concise.\n",
    "#zip(): The zip() function combines the three lists into a single iterable of tuples, which makes it easy to process corresponding elements from each list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#This approach is clean and efficient for processing the given data and performing the necessary computations."
